# Structure-Theoretic Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis

This repository presents a structure-theoretic approach to the Riemann Hypothesis by Mizuho Watanabe.  
It proposes that the critical line Re(s) = 1/2 emerges naturally from the symmetric decomposition of prime numbers and their spectral interference via Euler product.
